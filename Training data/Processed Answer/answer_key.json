    "question": "'Social disparity was one of the major causes of the French Revolution.' Justify by giving examples.",
    "answer": "(i) Division of the society into three Estate:\n- The First Estate: It consisted of the clergymen and church-fathers.\n- The Second Estate: It consisted of landlords, men of noble birth and aristocrats.\n- The Third Estate: It consisted of the vast majority of the common masses, the landless peasants, servants, etc.\n\n(ii) Heavy Burden of Taxes on the Third Estate: The members of the first two Estates were exempted from paying taxes to the state. So all the taxes were paid by the people of the Third Estate.\n\n(iii) Wide Gap between People of Different Estates: Most of the people of the Third Estate were employed as labourers in workshops with fixed wages. The wages failed to keep pace with the rise in prices. So the gap between the poor and the rich widened.\n\n(iv) No Political Rights: Out of the total population, the first and the second Estates had share of 2%. The remaining people belonged to the Third Estate. Although the upper two classes made up only a small fraction of the total population, yet they were the people who controlled the political and economic system of the nation. They enjoyed all the rights and privileges. The entire machinery of the government was designed to protect their interests and privileges.\n\n(v) Unequal Distribution of Wealth: In the French society, peasants made up about 90% of the population. However, only a small number of them owned the land they cultivated. About 60% of the land was owned by nobles, the church and other richer members of the Third Estate."

    "question": "Explain the role of thinkers and philosophers in the French Revolution.",
    "answer": "Influence of the Philosophers and Writers: There were many French philosophers and thinkers like John Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Voltaire and Mirabeau, who exposed the evils prevailing in the system. They infused people with the idea of liberty, equality and fraternity.\n\n(i) Charles Montesquieu (1689-1775): A nobleman by birth, he became a lawyer and a judge. In his book, “The Spirit of Laws\", he criticised autocracy and praised the democratic republic.\n\n(ii) Francis Aronet Voltaire (1694-1778): Voltaire was another outstanding philosopher of the Revolution. He wanted the people to think about their material life on earth, and forget about heaven. He condemned the Church which supported the privileged class, and ignored the poor.\n\n(iii) Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778): Rousseau is regarded as the architect of the French Revolution. He gave the slogan “Man was born free, yet he is everywhere in chains”. In the famous book, \"The Social Contract\", he proved that the government was the result of a social contract between the people on the one hand, and ruler on the other. So if the ruler did not fulfil the contract, the people had the right to withdraw their loyalty to him, and bring down the tyranny of the ruler, by revolting.\n\n(iv) John Locke: He was also a great political thinker. He wrote ‘Two Treatises of Government' in which he sought to refute the doctrine of the divine and the absolute right of the monarch.\n\n(v) The philosophers and thinkers believed that no group in a society should be privileged by birth. They supported a society based on freedom and equal laws."

    "question": "What is the main cause of the French Revolution?",
    "answer": "The French Revolution, which began in 1789, was driven by multiple interconnected causes. Here is a point-wise summary of the primary causes:\n\n1. Economic Hardship:\n- National Debt: France's involvement in expensive wars, including the American Revolution, led to a massive national debt.\n- Taxation Issues: The tax system was unfair, with the Third Estate (common people) bearing most of the tax burden while the First (clergy) and Second (nobility) Estates were largely exempt.\n- Food Shortages: Poor harvests in the 1780s led to food shortages and increased bread prices, causing widespread hunger and discontent.\n\n2. Social Inequality:\n- Estates System: French society was divided into three estates, with the Third Estate being the most populous but having the least power and privileges.\n- Privileges of the Nobility: The nobility enjoyed many privileges, including exemption from many taxes and special rights, which bred resentment among the common people.\n\n3. Political Discontent:\n- Absolute Monarchy: King Louis XVI's absolute rule and his inability to effectively address the nation's problems led to widespread dissatisfaction.\n- Lack of Representation: The Third Estate had little political power and demanded greater representation and influence in government decisions.\n\n4. Enlightenment Ideas:\n- Philosophical Influence: Enlightenment thinkers like Voltaire, Rousseau, and Montesquieu promoted ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity, challenging the traditional structures of power and authority.\n- Critique of Absolute Power: Enlightenment writings criticized absolute monarchy and advocated for democratic governance and individual rights.\n\n5. Financial Crisis:\n- Government Debt: The French government's inability to manage its finances effectively, coupled with extravagant spending by the monarchy, exacerbated the financial crisis.\n- Failure of Reforms: Attempts to reform the tax system and reduce debt were met with resistance from the nobility, leading to political stalemate.\n\n6. Immediate Triggers:\n- Calling of the Estates-General: In 1789, King Louis XVI called the Estates-General to address the financial crisis, leading to tensions between the estates."

    "question": "Evaluate the Impact of the French Revolution on the World.",
    "answer": "The French Revolution, which began in 1789, was a major turning point in history. It brought about significant changes not just in France but also around the world.\n\n1. Political Impact:\n- End of Monarchy: The French Revolution led to the end of the absolute monarchy in France. Kings and queens no longer had complete control, and people began to demand more democratic forms of government. This idea spread to other countries, leading to the decline of monarchies and the rise of republics.\n- Inspiration for Other Revolutions: The ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity inspired other countries to fight for their own freedom. For example, the Haitian Revolution and the Latin American wars of independence were influenced by the French Revolution.\n- Growth of Nationalism: The revolution helped people develop a sense of national pride and identity. This idea of nationalism spread across Europe and later influenced movements in other parts of the world.\n\n2. Social Impact:\n- Abolition of Feudalism: The French Revolution abolished the feudal system, which was a system where peasants had to work on the land owned by nobles. This led to more equality and freedom for the common people.\n- Rise of the Middle Class: The revolution empowered the middle class (bourgeoisie), who played a significant role in the revolution. This shift helped reduce the power of the nobility and increased the influence of ordinary citizens.\n- Human Rights: The Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, adopted during the revolution, promoted ideas like equality before the law, freedom of speech, and religious tolerance. These principles became important in many countries.\n\n3. Economic Impact:\n- Land Reforms: Land that was owned by the aristocracy was redistributed to the peasants. This helped improve the lives of many farmers and increased agricultural productivity.\n- Encouragement of Industry: The disruption of old economic systems during the revolution paved the way for industrialization. This shift from agriculture to industry eventually influenced economies worldwide.\n- Changes in Trade: The Napoleonic Wars, which followed the revolution, affected global trade. For example, Napoleon's blockades against Britain led to changes in trade routes and economic practices.\n\n4. Cultural Impact:\n- Spread of Enlightenment Ideas: The revolution was influenced by Enlightenment ideas, which emphasized reason, individualism, and skepticism of traditional authority. These ideas spread globally, influencing political and cultural thought.\n- Secularization: The revolution reduced the power of the Catholic Church in government affairs, promoting the separation of church and state. This trend influenced many countries around the world.\n- Art and Culture: The revolutionary period saw new artistic and cultural movements that reflected the values of liberty and equality. For example, Romanticism in art and literature was partly a response to the changes brought about by the revolution.\n\nConclusion: The French Revolution had a huge impact on the world. It changed political systems by ending absolute monarchies and inspiring other revolutions. Socially, it promoted equality and human rights. Economically, it encouraged industrialization and changed trade practices. Culturally, it spread new ideas and reduced the power of traditional authorities. The revolution's legacy continues to shape modern societies and governments, making it one of the most important events in history."

    "question": "Decribe the women condition before and after the French revolution.",
    "answer": "Conditions of Women Before the French Revolution\n\n1. Social Status:\n- Women were largely confined to domestic roles and had little to no involvement in public or political life.\n- Socially, women were seen as dependents of their fathers or husbands and were expected to manage households and bear children.\n\n2. Legal Rights:\n- Women had very limited legal rights. They could not own property independently, enter into contracts, or participate in legal proceedings without male permission.\n- Inheritance laws were unfavorable to women, often excluding them from property inheritance.\n\n3. Education and Employment:\n- Education for women was minimal and focused primarily on domestic skills rather than intellectual or professional development.\n- Employment opportunities were limited to low-paying and menial jobs, such as domestic service, textile work, or agriculture.\n\n4. Political Rights:\n- Women had no political rights. They could not vote, hold public office, or participate in the political process in any meaningful way.\n\nConditions of Women After the French Revolution\n\n1. Social Changes:\n- The Revolution promoted ideas of liberty and equality, which inspired women to demand greater social recognition and rights.\n- Women became more politically active, participating in clubs and societies and taking part in revolutionary activities like the Women's March on Versailles.\n\n2. Legal Reforms:\n- The Revolution led to some legal changes, such as the abolition of feudal privileges, which indirectly benefited women by removing some social and economic barriers.\n- However, many of the legal rights women sought, such as property ownership and divorce rights, were only partially or temporarily granted.\n\n3. Education and Employment:\n- Educational opportunities for women began to improve slightly as revolutionary ideals emphasized the importance of education for all citizens.\n- Employment opportunities expanded somewhat, but women continued to face significant discrimination and were often relegated to traditional roles.\n\n4. Political Involvement:\n- Women like Olympe de Gouges, who authored the \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,\" advocated for equal political rights and participation.\n- Despite their activism, women did not gain significant political rights during the Revolution. The new governments, including the National Assembly and later Napoleon's regime, largely excluded women from political life.\n\n5. Post-Revolution Backlash:\n- Under Napoleon, many of the gains made by women were rolled back. The Napoleonic Code reinforced traditional gender roles and restricted women's rights in areas such as marriage, divorce, and property.\n\nConclusion: The French Revolution brought some initial changes and a greater awareness of women's rights and issues, but it fell short of achieving significant legal and social equality for women. The revolutionary period saw increased activism and political participation by women, but many of their demands were not met, and subsequent regimes often reinstated traditional patriarchal structures. Despite these setbacks, the Revolution laid the groundwork for future movements for women's rights and equality."

    "question": "Explain the factors affecting India's climate.",
    "answer": "(i) Latitude: The Tropic of Cancer passes through the middle of the country from the Rann of Kuchchh in the west to Mizoram in the east. Almost half of the country, lying south of the Tropic of Cancer, belongs to the tropical area. All the remaining area, north of the Tropic, lies in the sub-tropic. Therefore, India's climate has characteristics of tropical as well as subtropical climates.\n\n(ii) Altitude: India has mountains to the north which have an average height of about 6,000 metres. India also has a vast coastal area where the maximum elevation is about 30 metres. The Himalayas prevent the cold winds from Central Asia from entering the subcontinent. It is because of these mountains that this subcontinent experiences comparatively milder winters as compared to central Asia.\n\n(iii) Pressure and Winds: The pressure and wind conditions over India are unique. During winter, there is a high-pressure area north of the Himalayas. Cold dry winds blow from this region to the low-pressure areas over the oceans to the south. In summer, a low-pressure area develops over interior Asia as well as over northwestern India. This causes a complete reversal of the direction of winds during summer. Air moves from the high-pressure area over the southern Indian Ocean, in a south-easterly direction, crosses the equator, and turns right towards the low-pressure areas over the Indian subcontinent. These are known as the Southwest Monsoon winds. These winds blow over the warm oceans, gather moisture and bring widespread rainfall over the mainland of India."

The country was born through a partition on the basis of religious differences.\n2. This was a traumatic experience for the people of India and Pakistan. Atleast ten lakh people were killed on both sides of the border in partition related violence.\n3. The British had left it to the rulers of the princely states to decide whether they wanted to merge with India or with Pakistan or remain independent.\n4. The merger of these princely states was a difficult and uncertain task. When the Constitution was being written, the future of the country did not look as secure as it does today.\n5.

    "answer": "The human capital is indirectly and directly related with natural resources and physical capital. For modification of any natural resources to needed or valuable things physical capital or labour is needed, and to inspire or increase labour, human capital or money is needed. For example, we got the wheat as our natural resources and to modify it into a bread, industrial modification is needed which is operated by labour and machines made by humans by using their knowledge and skills.

    "answer": "Yes, Green revolution became a boon for us. It solved the problem of food shortage in India. It gave more yield from a small piece of land and helped the farmers to gain more income than earlier. Well irrigation facilities helped many people to grow crops throughout the year rather than depending on monsoon. But at the same time it became a ban. As the HYV seeds demand modern equipments small farmers cant afford it. The excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides pollute the soil by killing the bacteria and also pollute the ground water. Due to intense farming the soil will lost its fertility which further demands more chemical fertilizers. As we seen in the case of Punjab and Haryana."

  "22": {
    "question": "How do chemical fertilisers adversely affect the soil, groundwater, lakes and rivers? What were the effects of use of chemical fertilisers in the state of Punjab?",
    "answer": "(i) Chemical fertilizers provide minerals which dissolve in water and are immediately available to plants. But these may not be retained in the soil for long. They may escape from the soil and pollute groundwater, rivers and lakes.\n(ii) Chemical fertilizers can also kill bacteria and other micro-organisms in the soil. This means some time after the use, the soil will be less fertile than ever before.\n(iii) The consumption of chemical fertilizers in Punjab is highest in the country. The continuous use of chemical fertilizers has led to degradation of soil health.\n(iv) In order to maintain the same production level, the farmers in Punjab use more and more chemical fertilizers and other inputs. This has not only lowered the quality of the crops but also the quality of the soil."

There are four requirements for production of goods and services:\n(i) Land: No production activity can take place without land. It is the basic requirement. Other natural resources such as water, forests, minerals are also equally important.\n(ii) Labour: Labour means people who will do the work. Some production activities require highly educated workers to perform the necessary tasks. Other activities require workers who can do manual work. Each worker is providing the labour necessary for production.\n(iii) Physical Capital: Physical capital means the variety of inputs required at every stage during production. Tools, machines, buildings can be used in production over many years and are called fixed capital. Raw material and money in hand are called working capital. Unlike tools, machines and buildings, these are used up in production."

    "question": "Explain major reasons for a widespread poverty in India.",
    "answer": "1. British Rule: Britishers ruled India more than 100 years. Prior to the British rule, traditional industries, for instance, textiles, flourished in India. During the British rule, the government adopted policies to discourage such industries. This left millions of weavers poor. Even after fifty years of independent India, we can find a major section of the people engaged handicraft industries as, downtrodden.\n2. Lack of industrialisation: India is very backward from the industrial point of view. Hardly 3 per cent of the total working population is engaged in the large- scale industry.\n3. Over dependence on agriculture: Even after more than 60 years of independence more than 60 per cent of our total population still depends on agriculture for its livelihood. Due to shortage of inputs, our agriculture is backward.\n4. Inflationary pressure: Upward trend in prices adversely affects the poor sections of the society."

    "answer": "While determining the poverty line in India, a minimum level of food requirement, clothing, footwear, fuel and light, educational and medical requirement etc, are determined for subsistence.\ni) The calorie requirement depending upon the age, sex, area and type of work is the way of estimating poverty. Average calorie requirement in India is 2400 per person per day in rural areas and 2100 per persons per day in urban areas.\nii) Monetary expenditure per capita needed is also a way of estimating poverty. In the year 2011-12, the poverty for a person was fixed Rs 816 per month for the rural areas and Rs 1000 for the urban areas.\nA uniform standard for poverty line is also used, which is given by international organisation like the World Bank for the poverty line: minimum availability of the equivalent of $1.90 per person per day (2011, ppp)."

Bihar and Odisha continue to be the two poorest states with poverty ratios of 33.7 and 32.6 per cent respectively. Along with rural poverty, urban poverty is also high in Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.\n4. In comparison, there has been a significant decline in poverty in Kerala, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, TamilNadu, Gujarat and West Bengal.\n5. States like Punjab and Haryana have traditionally succeeded in reducing poverty with the help of high agricultural growth rates. Kerala has focused more on human resource development. In West Bengal, land reform measures have helped in reducing poverty. In Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu public distribution of food grains could have been responsible for the improvement."

    "answer": "Amidst his adversity, Lencho maintained his faith in God. He believed that God had seen his suffering and would help him. His faith was so strong that he wrote a letter to God, asking for one hundred pesos to sow a new crop, as his previous one was destroyed by the hailstorm."

  },
  "56": {
    "question": "Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?",

He was completely certain it was from God. In fact, he became angry that the amount was less than one hundred pesos, believing the post office employees had stolen the difference, as he was sure God would not make a mistake or send less than what he asked for."

  "57": {
    "question": "There are two kinds of conflict in the story (A Letter to God): between humans and nature, and between humans themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?",
    "answer": "The conflict between humans and nature is shown when the hailstorm, a natural force, destroys Lencho's crops, leaving him helpless.\nThe conflict between humans is illustrated by the dramatic irony at the end. The postmaster acts with kindness and generosity to help Lencho, but Lencho, distrusting other people, wrongly accuses the post office employees of stealing part of the money God sent him. This highlights a conflict rooted in misunderstanding and a lack of faith in fellow humans."

    "answer": "Mandela thanks the international leaders for coming to witness his inauguration as the first Black President of South Africa. He feels privileged to welcome them because, not long before, South Africa was considered an outlaw nation due to its policy of apartheid.

    "question": "At the beginning of his speech, Mandela mentions 'an extraordinary human disaster'. What does he mean by this? What is the 'glorious human achievement' he speaks of at the end?",
    "answer": "The 'extraordinary human disaster' that Mandela refers to is the policy of apartheid in South Africa. It was a system of racial segregation and discrimination where Black people were oppressed and denied basic rights.

    "question": "“They were beckoning to him, calling shrilly.” Why did the seagull’s father and mother threaten him and cajole him to fly?",
    "answer": "The young seagull's parents threatened and cajoled him because he was too afraid to make his first flight. While his siblings had already learned to fly, he remained on the ledge, overcome by his fear of the vast sea below. His parents used every tactic—encouragement, taunting, and threatening to let him starve—to push him to overcome his fear and learn the essential survival skill of flying."
  },
  "63": {
    "question": "“The sight of the food maddened him.” What does this suggest? What compelled the young seagull to fly finally?",
    "answer": "The phrase suggests that the young seagull's hunger had become unbearable and desperate. He had been left alone for over twenty-four hours without food. The final push that compelled him to fly was an act by his mother. She tore a piece of fish and flew close to his ledge but stopped just out of reach. Maddened by hunger and the sight of the food, the seagull dived for it, falling from the ledge. In that moment of terror, his survival instinct took over, his wings spread automatically, and he found himself flying."

    "answer": "Yes, I had a similar experience when learning to ride a bicycle. I was terrified of falling and getting hurt, so I kept giving up. My parents consistently encouraged me. My father would hold the back of the seat to help me balance, but the moment he let go, I would panic and fall. However, their persistence and gentle encouragement gave me the confidence to keep trying. Gradually, I overcame my fear, and after many attempts, I was finally able to ride on my own."

    "question": "Why does the narrator say, “I landed and was not sorry to walk away from the old Dakota…”?",
    "answer": "The narrator says this to express his immense relief at being safely on the ground. He had just survived a terrifying experience, flying his old Dakota plane through a massive storm cloud with non-functioning instruments. Walking away from the plane was walking away from the fear and danger he had just faced. His primary feeling was gratitude for his survival, not sentimental attachment to the aircraft at that moment."
  },
  "66": {
    "question": "Describe the narrator’s experience as he flew the aeroplane into the storm.",
    "answer": "As the narrator flew into the storm, his plane began to jump and twist in the air. It was completely dark, and he could not see anything outside. His instruments, including the compass and radio, stopped working, leaving him lost and disoriented. The situation was terrifying, and the fuel was running low. Suddenly, he saw another black aeroplane without any lights, whose pilot gestured for him to follow. He followed the mysterious plane through the storm and was guided safely out of the clouds to an airport runway."
  },
  "67": {
    "question": "What made the woman in the control centre look at the narrator strangely?",
    "answer": "The woman in the control center looked at the narrator strangely because he asked about the 'other' black aeroplane that had guided him through the storm. She checked her radar and told him that no other planes were in the sky that night except for his. This revelation made the narrator's rescue a complete mystery."
  },
  "68": {
    "question": "Who do you think helped the narrator to reach safely? Discuss this among yourselves and give reasons for your answer.",
    "answer": "It is likely that the other pilot and the black aeroplane were a product of the narrator's own mind, a hallucination born out of desperation and fear. Facing a life-threatening situation, his own courage and piloting skill may have manifested as an external guide. He was a good pilot, and his subconscious may have projected this calming presence to help him navigate the storm and survive."

    "question": "How does the poet suggest that you identify the lion and the tiger? When can you do so, according to him?",
    "answer": "The poet suggests that you can identify an Asian Lion if a large, tawny (yellowish-brown) beast in an eastern jungle roars at you as it is about to kill you. You can identify a Bengal Tiger if a noble, wild beast with black stripes on a yellow coat greets you while roaming freely. According to the poet, you can make these identifications when you are about to become their prey."
  },
  "70": {
    "question": "Do you think the words ‘lept‘ and ‘lep’ in the third stanza are spelt correctly? Why does the poet spell them like this?",
    "answer": "No, the words are not spelled correctly. The correct spellings are 'leapt' and 'leap'. The poet deliberately misspells them to maintain the rhythm and rhyme scheme of the poem. This use of poetic license also adds a playful, humorous tone and emphasizes the identity of the animal in that stanza, the leopard."
  },
  "71": {
    "question": "Why does the poet say, “I would not intrude on him”? Why doesn’t he offer him money to buy another ball?",
    "answer": "The poet chooses not to intrude because he recognizes that the boy is going through a crucial learning experience. The loss of the ball is teaching the boy about responsibility and the nature of loss in a world of possessions. Offering money for a new ball would be pointless because a new ball cannot replace the memories associated with the lost one, and it would undermine the important lesson the boy is learning about coping with loss on his own."
  },
  "72": {
    "question": "Do you think the boy lost anything earlier? Pick out the words that suggest the answer.",
    "answer": "No, it seems this is the first time the boy has experienced such a significant loss. The line that suggests this is: 'He senses first responsibility in a world of possessions.' The phrase 'first responsibility' indicates that this is a new and formative experience for him."
  },
  "73": {
    "question": "What does the poet say the boy is learning from the loss of the ball? Try to explain this in your own words.",
    "answer": "The poet says the boy is learning a fundamental lesson about life: how to cope with loss. He is understanding the harsh reality that things, and even people, can be lost forever and cannot always be replaced. This experience teaches him to stand up to grief, to be resilient, and to accept that loss is an inevitable part of life. He is learning to take responsibility and move on."

    "question": "What makes writing in a diary a strange experience for Anne Frank?",
    "answer": "Writing in a diary was a strange experience for Anne for two main reasons. First, she had never written in one before. Second, and more importantly, she felt that no one, including herself later on, would be interested in the private thoughts and 'musings of a thirteen-year-old schoolgirl.' It felt strange to be confiding her deepest feelings to an inanimate object."
  },
  "75": {
    "question": "Why does Anne want to keep a diary?",
    "answer": "Anne wants to keep a diary because she feels lonely and believes she has no true friends with whom she can share her innermost thoughts and feelings. She says, 'Paper has more patience than people.' She hopes the diary, which she names 'Kitty,' will become her confidante and best friend, allowing her to get all her worries and burdens off her chest."
  },
  "76": {
    "question": "Why does Anne need to give a brief sketch of her family? Does she treat ‘Kitty’ as an insider or an outsider?",
    "answer": "Anne gives a brief sketch of her family so that anyone reading her diary can understand her world and the context of her stories. She treats 'Kitty' as an insider, a true friend. By providing this background information, she is not writing for a stranger but rather confiding in her friend, just as one would when introducing their family to a new close acquaintance."
  },
  "77": {
    "question": "What tells you that Anne loved her grandmother?",
    "answer": "Anne's love for her grandmother is evident in several ways. She mentions that her grandmother's death in 1942 affected her deeply, writing, 'No one knows how often I think of her and still love her.' Furthermore, during her thirteenth birthday celebration, Anne lit a separate candle specifically for her grandmother, showing that she was still very much in her thoughts and heart."
  },
  "78": {
    "question": "Anne says teachers are most unpredictable. Is Mr. Keesing unpredictable? How?",
    "answer": "Yes, Mr. Keesing proves to be unpredictable. Initially, he seems strict and annoyed by Anne's talkative nature, punishing her by assigning extra homework in the form of essays. However, he shows his unpredictable side when, instead of getting angrier with Anne's witty essays, he takes them in good humor. He eventually enjoys her final poem so much that he reads it to multiple classes and allows her to talk without giving her any more punishments."
  },
  "79": {
    "question": "How old do you think Amanda is? How do you know this?",
    "answer": "Amanda is likely a young school-aged child, perhaps around 9-10 years old. We can infer this from the nature of the instructions her parent gives her, such as 'Don't bite your nails,' 'Did you finish your homework?,' and 'Tidy your room.' These are common corrections for children of that age. Additionally, her imaginative escapes into being a mermaid or Rapunzel are typical of a young child's fantasy world."
  },
  "80": {
    "question": "What could Amanda do if she were a mermaid?",
    "answer": "If Amanda were a mermaid, she imagines herself drifting blissfully and peacefully alone in a calm, emerald-green sea. She envisions herself as the sole inhabitant of this sea, moving slowly and languidly in the water. This fantasy represents her desire for freedom and tranquility, away from the constant nagging she experiences."
  },
  "81": {
    "question": "Is Amanda an orphan? Why does she say so?",
    "answer": "No, Amanda is not an orphan; she has a parent who is speaking to her throughout the poem. She says she wishes she were an orphan because she romanticizes the idea of having complete freedom. To her, being an orphan means she could roam the streets aimlessly, draw patterns in the dust with her bare feet, and enjoy a 'golden' silence and 'sweet' freedom without anyone nagging or controlling her."
  },
  "82": {
    "question": "Do you know the story of Rapunzel? Why does Amanda want to be Rapunzel?",
    "answer": "The story of Rapunzel is about a princess with long hair who is locked away in a tall tower by a witch. Amanda wants to be Rapunzel because she desires a life of peace and solitude in a tower, away from everyone. However, she adds a twist to her fantasy: she would never let down her bright hair, ensuring that no one could ever climb up and disturb her tranquility. This highlights her deep longing for isolation and independence."
  },
  "83": {
    "question": "What does the girl yearn for? What does the poem tell you about Amanda?",
    "answer": "Amanda yearns for freedom, peace, and the space to be herself without constant correction and control from her parents. The poem tells us that Amanda is an imaginative and sensitive young girl who feels oppressed by the endless rules and expectations placed upon her. She escapes into a rich fantasy world to find the freedom and peace she lacks in her real life."

    "question": "When would the baker come every day? Why did the children run to meet him?",
    "answer": "The baker would come twice a day: once in the morning on his selling round, and again in the evening after he had sold all his bread and was returning with his empty basket.\nThe children would run to meet him not just for the loaves of bread, but because they longed for the special bread-bangles he brought for them.

    "question": "What does Chubukov at first suspect that Lomov has come for? Is he sincere when he later says, “And I’ve always loved you, my angel, as if you were my own son”?",
    "answer": "Initially, Chubukov suspects that Lomov has come to borrow money because Lomov is dressed in formal evening wear. Chubukov is not at all sincere in his affectionate words. His insincerity is clear from his aside to the audience, where he decides he will not give Lomov any money. His tone changes from suspicious to overjoyed only when he learns that Lomov has come to propose to his daughter, revealing that his earlier affection was completely fake and opportunistic."
  },
  "86": {
    "question": "Chubukov says of Natalya: “… as if she won’t consent! She’s in love; egad, she’s like a lovesick cat…” Would you agree? Find reasons for your answer.",
    "answer": "I would not fully agree that Natalya is 'like a lovesick cat,' as her behavior is very argumentative. However, her reaction when she finds out Lomov came to propose proves that she is indeed desperate to marry him. Despite arguing fiercely with Lomov over property and dogs, the moment he leaves, she becomes hysterical, starts weeping, and begs her father to bring him back immediately. This dramatic shift shows that beneath her combative exterior, she is very keen on the marriage."

    "question": "When her son dies, Kisa Gotami goes from house to house. What does she ask for? Does she get it? Why not?",
    "answer": "Overcome with grief, Kisa Gotami goes from house to house carrying her dead son, asking for medicine that could bring him back to life. She does not get it because her son is already dead, and no medicine can cure death. The villagers think she has lost her mind."
  },
  "88": {
    "question": "Kisa Gotami again goes from house to house after she speaks with the Buddha. What does she ask for, the second time around? Does she get it? Why not?",
    "answer": "The second time, after speaking with the Buddha, Kisa Gotami goes from house to house asking for a handful of mustard seeds. However, the Buddha gave her a condition: the seeds must come from a house where no one has ever lost a loved one to death. She does not get the mustard seeds because she cannot find a single house untouched by death. Every family she visits has experienced the loss of a child, parent, spouse, or friend."
  },
  "89": {
    "question": "What does Kisa Gotami understand the second time that she failed to understand the first time? Was this what the Buddha wanted her to understand?",
    "answer": "The second time, Kisa Gotami understands that death is universal and an inevitable part of life. In her initial grief, she was focused only on her own personal sorrow. Her journey from house to house makes her realize that every family shares the experience of loss. Yes, this was precisely what the Buddha wanted her to understand: that all mortals are subject to death and that selfish grief is futile."
  },
  "90": {
    "question": "Why do you think Kisa Gotami understood this only the second time? In what way did the Buddha change her understanding?",
    "answer": "Kisa Gotami understood the lesson only the second time because her first journey was clouded by overwhelming personal grief. The Buddha changed her understanding by giving her a practical, experiential task rather than a direct lecture. By making her search for a house untouched by death, he guided her to discover the universal truth of suffering and mortality for herself, which was a much more powerful way for her to accept reality."
  },

    "question": "How do you usually understand the idea of ‘selfishness’? Do you agree with Kisa Gotami that she was being ‘selfish in her grief’?",
    "answer": "Selfishness is usually understood as being concerned only with one's own needs or interests, without regard for others. Yes, I agree with Kisa Gotami's realization. In her profound grief, she was so consumed by her own pain that she couldn't see the world beyond it. She believed her suffering was unique and could be reversed, failing to recognize that loss and death are a shared human experience that everyone must face."

    "question": "What did Valli find out about the bus journey? How did she find out these details?",
    "answer": "Valli found out several key details: the bus journey to the town was six miles long, took forty-five minutes, and the one-way fare was thirty paise. She gathered this information by carefully listening to the conversations of her neighbors and other regular bus travelers, and by asking a few discreet questions herself."

    "question": "Why did Valli stand up on the seat? What does she see now?",
    "answer": "Valli stood up on the seat because her view was blocked by the canvas blind that covered the lower part of her window. By standing up, she could see over the blind. She then saw the full landscape: the bus running along the bank of a canal, with palm trees, distant mountains, and vast green fields on one side, and a deep ditch on the other."

    "question": "How did Valli save up money for her first journey? Was it easy for her?",
    "answer": "Valli saved money by meticulously collecting every stray coin she could find. It was not easy for her. She had to resist many temptations, such as buying peppermints, toys, and balloons. Most notably, she had to suppress a strong desire to ride the merry-go-round at the village fair to save the sixty paise needed for her round-trip journey."

    "question": "Why didn’t Valli get off the bus at the bus station?",
    "answer": "Valli didn't get off the bus because her plan was only to experience the bus ride itself, not to explore the town. She also had limited money—exactly sixty paise for the round-trip fare—and no extra to spend. Furthermore, she was on a strict timeline, needing to return home before her mother woke up from her afternoon nap."

    "question": "How did Valli plan her bus ride? What did she find out about the bus, and how did she save up the fare?",
    "answer": "Valli planned her bus ride methodically. First, she gathered information by listening to conversations and asking questions, learning the trip's duration (45 minutes), distance (6 miles), and fare (30 paise each way). Next, she saved the required sixty paise by resisting temptations like buying toys and riding the merry-go-round. Finally, she chose the time for her journey—the afternoon, when her mother would be napping—to ensure her secret adventure would not be discovered."

    "question": "What colour is the young woman’s hair? What does she say she can change it to? Why would she want to do so?",
    "answer": "The young woman's hair is a honey-yellow color. She says she can dye it black, brown, or carrot-orange. She would want to change her hair color to prove a point: that external beauty is superficial and can be easily altered. She wants to be loved for her inner self, not for her physical appearance like her yellow hair."

    "question": "Why does he go to Basra? How long does he wait there, and why?",
    "answer": "The author, Gavin Maxwell, went to Basra to collect his mail from Europe at the Consulate-General. He had to wait there for five days because his mail was delayed. His friend's mail had arrived, but his had not. He tried cabling and phoning England, but a series of technical issues and a holiday closure delayed the process until his mail finally arrived."

    "question": "How does he get the otter? Does he like it? Pick out the words that tell you this.",
    "answer": "He gets the otter as a surprise gift from his friend. After his mail finally arrives, he finds two Arabs in his room with a sack, which contains the otter and a note from his friend. Yes, he likes it very much. The words that show this are when he describes his immediate and lasting fascination as an 'otter fixation,' a powerful attachment he believes all otter owners feel."

    "question": "How was Mij to be transported to England?",
    "answer": "Since the British airline would not allow animals, Maxwell booked a flight to Paris on a different airline that did. The airline insisted that Mijbil (Mij) had to be transported in a small box, no more than eighteen inches square, which had to be placed on the floor at the author's feet."
  },
  "101": {
    "question": "Why does Maxwell say the air hostess was “the very queen of her kind”?",
    "answer": "Maxwell calls the air hostess 'the very queen of her kind' out of deep gratitude and admiration for her kindness and understanding. After Mijbil escaped from his box and caused a brief panic, she did not scold Maxwell. Instead, she sympathized with him and suggested he keep his pet on his knee for the rest of the flight, an act of compassion that earned his profound respect."
