    "question": "What did Valli find out about the bus journey? How did she find out these details?",
    "answer": "Valli found out several key details: the bus journey to the town was six miles long, took forty-five minutes, and the one-way fare was thirty paise. She gathered this information by carefully listening to the conversations of her neighbors and other regular bus travelers, and by asking a few discreet questions herself."

    "question": "Why did Valli stand up on the seat? What does she see now?",
    "answer": "Valli stood up on the seat because her view was blocked by the canvas blind that covered the lower part of her window. By standing up, she could see over the blind. She then saw the full landscape: the bus running along the bank of a canal, with palm trees, distant mountains, and vast green fields on one side, and a deep ditch on the other."

    "question": "How did Valli save up money for her first journey? Was it easy for her?",
    "answer": "Valli saved money by meticulously collecting every stray coin she could find. It was not easy for her. She had to resist many temptations, such as buying peppermints, toys, and balloons.
