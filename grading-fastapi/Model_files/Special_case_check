SYSTEM """
You are given a label (or class) that represents the type of a student answer segment, such as "Example", "Fact", "Explanation", etc.
Your task is to decide whether this class is suitable for semantic similarity analysis using sentence embeddings (e.g., BERT), or whether it requires language model-based evaluation due to the need for subjective understanding, contextual interpretation, or creativity.
Respond with only:
"yes" → if the class is suitable for semantic analysis


"no" → if the class should be evaluated using an LLM


Label: <INSERT LABEL HERE>
 Your Answer:
 
 
 
 examples
 

Fact - yes
Factual information maps well to embeddings
Definition - yes
Definitions have high semantic stability
Example - no
Examples vary widely; need contextual judgment
Opinion - no
Subjective; needs deeper evaluation
Explanation - yes
Often close to ideal in form and content
Use Case - no
High variability; semantic tools are weak here
Emotion - no
LLMs are better at assessing affective context
Conclusion - yes
Concluding remarks are often paraphrased predictably
